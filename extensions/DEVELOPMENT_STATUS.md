# VS Code Extension Development

The Disco MCP VS Code extension has been successfully implemented and packaged. This represents the completion of the major IDE integration milestone outlined in the roadmap.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Container Management**
   - Tree view for all containers with real-time status
   - Create, delete, and monitor containers directly from VS Code
   - Visual status indicators (running, stopped, error states)

2. **Integrated Terminal**
   - Native VS Code terminal integration with Disco containers
   - Interactive command execution with real-time output
   - Persistent sessions across VS Code restarts
   - Full bidirectional communication with containers

3. **File Synchronization**
   - Manual and automatic file sync between workspace and containers
   - Smart file filtering (ignores build artifacts, dependencies)
   - Progress tracking for large sync operations
   - Bidirectional sync capabilities

4. **Git Integration**
   - Direct git operations on container repositories
   - Status monitoring and change tracking
   - Commit, push, pull capabilities

### Technical Architecture

- **TypeScript Implementation**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Modular Design**: Separate managers for terminals, files, and containers
- **VS Code API Integration**: Native tree views, terminals, and commands
- **HTTP + WebSocket Client**: Robust communication with Disco MCP server
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Package Details

- **Extension Package**: `disco-mcp-extension-1.0.0.vsix` (5.63MB)
- **Files**: 653 files including compiled JavaScript and dependencies
- **Compatibility**: VS Code 1.74.0 and higher
- **License**: MIT

### Installation & Usage

The extension can be installed via:
1. VSIX package installation in VS Code
2. Manual installation from source for development

Configuration requires:
- Disco MCP server URL
- Valid API key for authentication

### Impact on Development Workflow

This extension provides seamless integration between VS Code and Disco containers, enabling:
- Direct container management without leaving the IDE
- Real-time terminal access to container environments
- Automatic file synchronization for seamless development
- Git operations directly on container repositories

## Next Steps

With the VS Code extension complete, the roadmap continues with:
1. IntelliJ/WebStorm plugin development
2. Real-time collaboration features
3. Advanced conflict resolution mechanisms

This milestone significantly enhances the developer experience and represents a major step toward complete IDE integration as outlined in the roadmap.
