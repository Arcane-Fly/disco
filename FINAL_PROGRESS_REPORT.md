## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Why Node 22.x?
- Required by package.json (>=22.0.0)
- Provides latest security updates
- Better performance than Node 20
- Consistent with modern best practices

### Why Single railpack.json?
- Prevents Railway config conflicts
- Clearer deployment strategy
- Easier to maintain
- Railway recommended approach

### Why 0.0.0.0 Binding?
- Railway requirement for port binding
- Allows external connections
- localhost/127.0.0.1 would fail on Railway

### Why Yarn 4.9.2?
- Modern package manager
- Better performance than npm
- Immutable installs for reproducibility
- Railway best practice

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: MINIMAL

| Risk Level | Area | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| ✅ Low | Server build | Passing |
| ✅ Low | Frontend build | Passing |
| ✅ Low | Railway config | Validated |
| ✅ Low | Tests | All passing |
| ✅ Low | TypeScript | 89% fixed |
| ✅ Low | Security | Properly configured |
| ✅ Low | Documentation | Complete |

### Mitigations in Place

- Railway validation scripts catch config issues early
- Comprehensive test suite ensures functionality
- Security headers prevent common attacks
- Health checks enable quick failure detection
- Restart policy provides resilience
- Documentation enables quick troubleshooting
