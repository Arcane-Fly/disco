## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions:
1. **Yarn Over NPM**: Following master cheat sheet for consistency and modern package management
2. **Gradual Type Safety**: Allowing deployment while incrementally improving types
3. **Protocol-First**: Planning for MCP and A2A integration from the start
4. **Railway Optimization**: Single railpack.json config to avoid conflicts

### Lessons Learned:
1. **TypeScript Strictness**: Can be gradually increased without blocking deployment
2. **Railway Config**: Multiple build configs cause plan conflicts - use single approach
3. **Health Checks**: Critical for Railway deployment reliability  
4. **Package Manager**: Corepack simplifies Yarn version management across environments
