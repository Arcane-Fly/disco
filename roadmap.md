# Disco MCP Server Roadmap

## Project Vision
Transform Disco into a fully ChatGPT-compliant MCP (Model Control Plane) server that provides seamless development environment integration through WebContainers technology.

## Executive Summary

**MCP Server with WebContainer Integration**
- **Goal**: Create a bridge between ChatGPT and a fully functional development environment
- **Platform**: Railway.com deployment with WebContainer technology
- **Current Status**: Core infrastructure complete, key implementation gaps identified

  - Health monitoring (/health) ✅ Functional

- [x] **Infrastructure & Deployment**
  - Docker containerization
  - Railway deployment configuration
  - Socket.IO WebSocket support
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Environment variable management

### ✅ Completed ChatGPT Integration (Phase 2)
- [x] **Discovery & Documentation**

  - Discovery endpoints (/, /config, /capabilities)
  - MCP plugin manifest (/.well-known/ai-plugin.json)

- [x] **ChatGPT-Specific Compliance**
  - CORS configuration for https://chatgpt.com
  - CSP headers for frame-ancestors
  - WebSocket URL exposure via /config endpoint

- [x] **OAuth & Security**
  - GitHub OAuth integration setup
  - Environment variable validation
  - Security headers and rate limiting

### 🚧 Critical Implementation Gaps Identified

**High Priority - Core Functionality Missing**
- [ ] **Real WebContainer API Integration**
  - Current: Helper functions are stubbed (listFiles, createFile, readFile, etc.)
  - Required: Implement actual WebContainer.fs and container.spawn() calls
  - Impact: Core functionality not working
  - Effort: 3-4 days

- [ ] **Missing API Endpoints**
  - Computer-use capabilities (/api/v1/computer-use) - Not implemented
  - RAG search functionality (/api/v1/rag) - Not implemented
  - Impact: Advertised capabilities not available
  - Effort: 4-5 days

**Medium Priority - Infrastructure Improvements**
- [ ] **Redis Session Management**
  - Current: Using in-memory Map instead of Redis
  - Impact: Sessions lost on restart, no horizontal scaling
  - Effort: 1-2 days

- [ ] **Background Worker Implementation**
  - Current: Procfile defines worker but worker.ts needs completion
  - Impact: No automated container cleanup
  - Effort: 1-2 days

## Phase 3: 🔧 Core Implementation (Current Priority)

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Implement Real WebContainer Operations** (Priority 1)
   - Replace stubbed file operations with WebContainer.fs API calls
   - Implement real git operations using container.spawn()
   - Add actual terminal command execution
   - Implement proper error handling for container operations

2. **Add Missing Endpoints** (Priority 2)
   - Implement computer-use endpoints (screenshot, click, type)
   - Add basic RAG search functionality
   - Ensure proper authentication and validation

3. **Infrastructure Completion** (Priority 3)
   - Migrate session storage from Map to Redis
   - Complete background worker implementation
   - Add comprehensive container cleanup

### Technical Debt Resolution
- **Container URL Generation**: Replace placeholder URLs with real WebContainer URLs
- **Command Security**: Enhance command validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses across all endpoints
- **Logging**: Implement structured logging for better debugging

## Phase 4: 🚀 Production Optimization (Weeks 3-4)

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Container Management Optimization**
  - Smart container pre-warming
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Auto-scaling based on demand
  - Container pooling improvements

### Security Hardening
- [ ] **Advanced Security Features**
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Command injection prevention
  - Rate limiting per endpoint
  - Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit test coverage >80%
  - Integration tests for all API endpoints
  - End-to-end testing with ChatGPT
  - Performance and load testing

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Current Performance Status
| Metric | Target | Current Status | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Container initialization | < 3 seconds | Not measured (stubbed) | Need real implementation |
| API response time | < 500ms | ~50ms (stubbed) | Real implementation needed |
| System uptime | > 99.5% | ~99% (Railway) | Good |
| Error rate | < 1% | ~0% (stubbed) | Will increase during implementation |

### Feature Completion Progress
| Feature Category | Planned | Structured | Implemented | Tested | Production Ready |
|------------------|---------|------------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| Authentication | 5 endpoints | ✅ 5 | ✅ 5 | ⚠️ 0 | ✅ 5 |
| Container Management | 4 endpoints | ✅ 4 | ⚠️ 2 | ⚠️ 0 | ⚠️ 2 |
| File Operations | 6 endpoints | ✅ 6 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| Git Operations | 4 endpoints | ✅ 4 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| Terminal Operations | 3 endpoints | ✅ 3 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| Computer Use | 3 endpoints | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| RAG Search | 1 endpoint | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **WebContainer API Complexity**: Integration may be more complex than anticipated
  - Mitigation: Start with simple operations, build incrementally
- **ChatGPT Compatibility**: Real implementation may not work with ChatGPT
  - Mitigation: Test with actual ChatGPT integration early
- **Performance Under Load**: Stubbed implementations give false performance indicators
  - Mitigation: Implement performance monitoring from day 1

### Technical Dependencies
- **WebContainer API**: Core dependency for all container operations
- **Railway Platform**: Deployment and scaling platform (working well)
- **Redis Service**: Session management (configured but not implemented)
- **GitHub API**: Repository operations (OAuth working)

## Next Steps for Completion
