## 🚧 Current Blockers/Issues:

### Known Issues:
- **Frontend Build**: Next.js build failing with different TypeScript issues (separate from server)
- **Peer Dependencies**: Yarn warnings about incorrectly met peer dependencies
- **SSH2 Binding**: Optional crypto binding build failure (non-critical)

### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk**: Server builds and runs successfully
- **Medium Risk**: Frontend deployment may need separate attention  
- **Low Risk**: Type errors are non-blocking and can be addressed incrementally

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions:
1. **Yarn Over NPM**: Following master cheat sheet for consistency and modern package management
2. **Gradual Type Safety**: Allowing deployment while incrementally improving types
3. **Protocol-First**: Planning for MCP and A2A integration from the start
4. **Railway Optimization**: Single railpack.json config to avoid conflicts

### Lessons Learned:
1. **TypeScript Strictness**: Can be gradually increased without blocking deployment
2. **Railway Config**: Multiple build configs cause plan conflicts - use single approach
3. **Health Checks**: Critical for Railway deployment reliability  
4. **Package Manager**: Corepack simplifies Yarn version management across environments
