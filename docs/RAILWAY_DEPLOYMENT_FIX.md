# Railway Deployment Fix - Yarn 4.9.2 Corepack Configuration

## Issue Summary

Railway deployment was failing during the build phase with the following error pattern:
```
error This project's package.json defines "packageManager": "yarn@4.9.2". However the current global version of Yarn is 1.22.22.
```

The rapid execution of `yarn install --immutable` (0.02s) confirmed no dependencies were processed due to the version mismatch.

## Root Cause

The project requires Yarn 4.9.2 via Corepack (as specified in `package.json`), but Railway's build environment uses the global Yarn 1.22.22 by default. Corepack needs to be explicitly enabled before running yarn commands.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `railpack.json`

**Before:**
```json
"steps": {
  "install": {
    "commands": [
      "yarn install --immutable"
    ],
    "caches": ["npm-cache"]
  },
```

**After:**
```json
"steps": {
  "install": {
    "commands": [
      "corepack enable",
      "yarn install --immutable"
    ],
    "caches": ["npm-cache"]
  },
```

### 2. Updated `.yarnrc.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
nodeLinker: node-modules
enableImmutableInstalls: false
```

**After:**
```yaml
nodeLinker: node-modules
enableImmutableInstalls: true
```

## Verification

The fix was verified through:

1. **Local Railway Simulation**: Complete build process tested in clean environment
2. **Railway Validation Scripts**: All validation checks pass
3. **Health Endpoint Test**: Application starts correctly and responds to `/health`
4. **Configuration Validation**: All Railway configuration files validated

### Build Process Verification

```bash
# Simulate Railway build environment
corepack enable
yarn --version  # Returns: 4.9.2
yarn install --immutable  # Succeeds
yarn build  # Completes successfully
node dist/server.js  # Starts correctly
```

### Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T01:49:09.507Z",
  "uptime": 3,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "node_version": "v20.19.5",
  "environment": "development",
  "memory": {...},
  "containers": {...},
  "services": {...}
}
```

## Railway Deployment Requirements

This fix ensures Railway deployment will:

1. ✅ Enable Corepack automatically
2. ✅ Use correct Yarn version (4.9.2)
3. ✅ Install dependencies with `--immutable` flag
4. ✅ Build application successfully
5. ✅ Start server with `node dist/server.js`
6. ✅ Respond to health checks on `/health`

## Future Considerations

- **Yarn PnP**: Consider enabling Yarn Plug'n'Play for faster deployments
- **Build Caching**: Railway will cache node_modules for faster subsequent builds
- **Health Monitoring**: The health endpoint provides comprehensive status information
