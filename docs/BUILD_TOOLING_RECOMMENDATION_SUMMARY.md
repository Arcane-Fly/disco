### Why Nx?

1. **Perfect Stack Match** ‚úÖ
   - 99% JavaScript/TypeScript codebase
   - Native Next.js 15 + React 19 support
   - First-class Express.js integration

2. **Developer Experience** ‚úÖ
   - Terminal UI (Nx 21 feature)
   - Visual project graph
   - Easy for JS-focused team

3. **Modern Features** ‚úÖ
   - Incremental builds
   - Distributed caching
   - Affected commands
   - Custom version actions

4. **Low Risk** ‚úÖ
   - Incremental adoption
   - No code restructuring required
   - Easy rollback if needed

5. **Performance Gains** ‚úÖ
   - 50-99% faster builds (with caching)
   - 70-90% faster CI/CD
   - 30-60 min saved per developer per day

### Why Not Bazel/Pants?

‚ùå Overkill for current needs  
‚ùå Steep learning curve (Starlark)  
‚ùå High migration cost  
‚ùå Limited Python usage (1 file)

## Current State

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: TypeScript + Express.js (131 files)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 (49 files)
- **Python**: 1 test file only
- **Build**: Vanilla TypeScript + Next.js (no orchestration)

### Pain Points
- ‚ùå No incremental builds
- ‚ùå No task caching
- ‚ùå Sequential builds only
- ‚ùå No dependency graph awareness
- ‚ùå Slow CI/CD (3-6 minutes)
