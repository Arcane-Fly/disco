## 🔍 1. Functional Gaps Analysis

### 1.1 WebContainer Server Mode Limitations

**Issue:** WebContainer API requires client-side browser environment but server claims container capabilities.

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// src/lib/containerManager.ts:60-62
if (isServerEnvironment) {
  throw new Error('Container sessions not available in server environment. Use client-side WebContainer integration.');
}
```

**API Test Results:**
```
Container Creation: 500 - Service Unavailable
Error: "Container sessions not available in server environment"
```

**Impact:**
- Core container functionality unavailable in deployment environment
- REST API endpoints return errors for primary use case
- MCP protocol tools redirect to non-functional endpoints

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. **Option A: Real Container Proxy Implementation**
   - Implement Docker-based container backend
   - Create WebContainer API compatibility layer
   - Add container orchestration with proper isolation

2. **Option B: Client-Side Architecture Clarification**
   - Update documentation to clarify client-side requirements
   - Implement browser-based container management
   - Add clear separation between server and client capabilities

### 1.2 Package Manager Configuration Issues

**Issue:** Project uses Yarn 4.9.2 but deployment configuration expects npm.

**Evidence:**
```json
// railpack.json - Uses npm commands
"commands": ["npm ci", "npm run build"]

// package.json - Specifies Yarn
"packageManager": "yarn@4.9.2"
```

**Conflicts:**
- CI workflows use npm instead of yarn
- Railway deployment expects package-lock.json (ignored by .gitignore)
- Yarn Berry PnP features not utilized

### 1.3 Missing OAuth Flow Completeness

**Issue:** Incomplete OAuth implementation with CSP violations.

**Evidence from CSP Fix Documentation:**
- OAuth callback CSP violations prevent font loading
- Browser extension conflicts during authentication
- Multiple redirect fallback mechanisms required

**Status:** ✅ Partially resolved with CSP fixes, but architectural improvements needed

---

## 🔒 2. Security & Compliance Issues

### 2.1 Model Compliance Violations

**Critical Issue:** Project may use forbidden GPT-4 models violating security policies.

**User Security Rules:**
- **Rule:** "User explicitly requires that GPT-4 models should not be used in the codebase. GPT-4.1 family models are preferred and acceptable."
- **Rule:** "No LLM models released prior to 2025 are permitted unless explicitly approved"

**Evidence Found:**
```bash
# grep results show GPT-4 references
CHATGPT_INTEGRATION.md:37, 39, 105, 106, 168, 188
README.md:99, 113, 125, 177
```

**Compliance Framework Requirements:**
- SOC2 compliance framework specified in security policies
- GDPR compliance requirements
- HIPAA compliance mentioned in policy documents

### 2.2 CORS & CSP Security Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// Enhanced CSP with Google Fonts support
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    frameAncestors: ["'self'", "https://chat.openai.com", "https://chatgpt.com"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"]
  }
}
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Production CORS configuration with allowed origins
- ✅ Comprehensive rate limiting (global, auth, API-specific)
- ✅ Security headers via Helmet.js
- ✅ Environment variable validation

**Areas for Improvement:**
- `'unsafe-eval'` in scriptSrc should be removed if possible
- CSP reporting endpoint not implemented
- No integrity checks for external resources

### 2.3 Data Protection & Session Management

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Redis-based session persistence
- ✅ JWT tokens with proper expiration
- ✅ Session cleanup and timeout enforcement
- ✅ User access control per container

**Missing Elements:**
- Data retention policy enforcement
- Audit logging for compliance
- Encryption at rest specifications
- GDPR data deletion procedures
