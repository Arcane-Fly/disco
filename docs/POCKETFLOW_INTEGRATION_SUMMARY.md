# PocketFlow Integration - Quick Reference

**Related Document**: [Full Review](./DISCO_POCKETFLOW_INTEGRATION_REVIEW.md)  
**Status**: Proposal Phase  
**Date**: 2025-10-13

---

## What is This?

This document summarizes the proposal to integrate **PocketFlow** (a minimalistic LLM workflow framework) into the Disco MCP Server's workflow builder to enable sophisticated AI agent patterns.

---

## Quick Summary

### Current State
- ✅ Disco has a powerful visual workflow builder
- ❌ Missing high-level AI/agent abstractions (RAG, multi-agent, etc.)
- ❌ Users must manually wire low-level operations

### Proposed Enhancement
- ✅ Integrate PocketFlow's 100-line graph execution engine
- ✅ Add 15+ AI-specific node types (RAG, agents, LLM, multi-agent)
- ✅ Populate template marketplace with ready-made AI patterns
- ✅ Enable AI-generated node implementations (agentic coding)
- ✅ Support cross-language export (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust)

---

## Key Benefits

1. **Visual AI Workflows**: Drag-and-drop RAG pipelines, research agents, multi-agent voting
2. **Faster Development**: 15+ ready-made templates from PocketFlow cookbook
3. **Agentic Coding**: AI generates node implementations from descriptions
4. **Portability**: Export workflows to multiple languages
5. **Zero Bloat**: 100-line core, no heavy dependencies

---

## Example: RAG Pipeline Template

**Before** (Current):
- User manually creates 10+ generic nodes
- User writes custom code for each node
- User debugs type mismatches
- Time: 2-3 hours

**After** (With PocketFlow):
- User selects "RAG Pipeline" template from marketplace
- 4 pre-built nodes appear: Retrieve → Rerank → Augment → Generate
- Nodes connected with validated types
- Click "Execute" to run
- Time: 5 minutes

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Phase 1**: Foundation | 2 weeks | PocketFlow TypeScript port, execution engine |
| **Phase 2**: AI Nodes | 2 weeks | 15+ AI node types (LLM, RAG, agents) |
| **Phase 3**: Templates | 2 weeks | 8+ marketplace templates |
| **Phase 4**: Agentic Coding | 2 weeks | AI-generated implementations |
| **Phase 5**: Polish | 2 weeks | Production deployment |

**Total**: 10 weeks

## New Node Types (Examples)

### LLM Operations
- `llm_prompt`: Basic completion
- `llm_structured`: JSON/Pydantic output
- `llm_function_call`: Tool use

### RAG Operations
- `rag_retrieve`: Vector search (uses Disco's existing RAG API)
- `rag_rerank`: Relevance scoring
- `rag_augment`: Context formatting
- `rag_generate`: Final generation

### Agent Operations
- `agent_research`: Iterative research
- `agent_code_gen`: Code generation
- `agent_tool_use`: Tool orchestration

### Multi-Agent
- `multi_agent_debate`: Agent discussion
- `multi_agent_vote`: Majority voting
- `multi_agent_consensus`: Consensus building

## Alignment with Recent Work

**Sessions 8-10** established solid infrastructure:
- ✅ Railway deployment validated
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD working
- ✅ Contract validation system in place
- ✅ Build system optimized (Nx)

**PocketFlow integration builds on this:**
- ✅ No changes to deployment infrastructure
- ✅ Uses existing contract validation
- ✅ Leverages GitHub Actions for testing
- ✅ Compatible with WebContainers
- ✅ Purely additive (no breaking changes)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Because:
- ✅ Minimal footprint (100 lines of code)
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Incremental rollout (5 phases)
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Well-tested patterns from PocketFlow community

### Mitigations:
- Start with proof-of-concept (Phase 1)
- Test in WebContainer environment early
- Curate templates before marketplace release
- Human-in-the-loop for agentic coding

---

## Success Metrics

**Adoption**:
- Number of workflows using PocketFlow nodes
- Template downloads
- AI-generated implementations

**Technical**:
- Workflow execution latency < 500ms overhead
- 30+ node types
- Test coverage > 90%

**UX**:
- Time to first AI workflow < 5 minutes
- Template usage rate > 60%
- User satisfaction (NPS score)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This PR)
1. ✅ Review this proposal document
2. ✅ Discuss with stakeholders
3. ✅ Decide: Proceed to Phase 1 POC?

### If Approved
1. Port PocketFlow core to TypeScript (2-3 days)
2. Create proof-of-concept: RAG node + execution (2-3 days)
3. Demo to team
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Proceed to Phase 2
