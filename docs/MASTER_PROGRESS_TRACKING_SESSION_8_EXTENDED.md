## Quick Reference - Verification Commands

```bash
# Complete validation in one command
yarn railway:check-all && yarn build && yarn test:contracts

# Start server and test health
PORT=3000 node dist/src/server.js &
sleep 5
curl http://localhost:3000/health | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/mcp-manifest.json | jq '.endpoints'
kill %1

# Verify Node version consistency
grep -r "nodeVersion\|node-version\|node.*22" . --include="*.json" --include="*.yml" | grep -v node_modules
```

All commands should complete successfully with 100% pass rate.
